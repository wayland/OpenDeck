SCHEMATIC
=========

Downloaded symbols from UltraLibrarian (but had to modify)

Modifications:
-	Set the component background to the correct colour
-	Set all the pin types correctly
-	cf. https://klc.kicad.org/symbol/s4/s4.3/ (and all of section 4)


PCB LAYOUT HELPS
================

For PCB layout, see:
-	Notes on sheets:
	-	PoE
	-	Original OpenDeck 3.1.0
-	Datasheets for:
	-	https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/iEthernet/W5500/w5500-evb-pico


SOFTWARE
========
Things to do:
-	Hardware:
	-	Put in config for my setup
	-	Put DMX stuff back in
	-	Make it talk over SPI bus to other RP2040s
		-	See https://circuitstate.com/tutorials/making-two-raspberry-pi-pico-boards-communicate-through-spi-using-c-cpp-sdk/
		-	First byte of each packet says whether it's:
			0:	Control codes
				0:	SYN
				1:	ACK + ID String
			1:	DMX
			2:	MIDI v1
			3:	MIDI v2 <-- includes Capability Inquiries; when libraries exist for this, it could be useful.  https://amenote.com/?page_id=74
	-	Make it work with W5500
		-	Make it talk to W5500
		-	Make it talk RTP-MIDI
		-	Link RTP-MIDI to other MIDI stuff
	-	Make traffic LEDs operate (basic)

Things to do eventually:
-	See if I can make config modular
-	Build in a web interface
-	(After redesign) See if we can attach MIDI link stuff to chip (so we can do DIN MLALs properly): https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/midi-connection-sense-circuit/
	-	See if we can get (DIN) MIDI to do Active Sense: http://midi.teragonaudio.com/tech/midispec/sense.htm -- but keep in mind that MIDI 2.0 doesn't allow for DIN
-	Make it work with MIDI 2.0:
