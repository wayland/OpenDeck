# OpenDeck MIDI Platform

OpenDeck is a platform for building MIDI controllers. It is a firmware running on various boards which transforms them into class-compliant USB MIDI devices, making them compatible with any MIDI software on any operating system. OpenDeck is designed to solve two problems when building a MIDI controller:

* Coding - there is no need to code anything in order to make changes to the controller or to make it work
* Making the controller behave the way you want it to - the firmware supports huge number of configurable parameters, all configurable in a Web browser

Solving this two goals means you can forget about implementation details and focus on having your custom controller built as fast as possible.

Configurator is available either [online](https://config.shanteacontrols.com) or [offline](https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeckUI/releases).

## Features

The following components are supported:

* Buttons
* Encoders
* LEDs (single color or RGB)
* Potentiometers
* FSRs (force-sensitive resistors)
* LCD/OLED displays
* Touchscreen displays (Nextion and Viewtech/Stone)

OpenDeck supports sending of both 7-bit and 14-bit Non-Registered Part Numbers (NRPN), latching messages on buttons, various encoding modes for quadrature encoders, LED control using MIDI In, configurable MIDI channels for each component individually, Bluetooth MIDI etc. Full list of supported features can be found [here](https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeck/wiki/Configurable-features).

If the feature you want isn't supported yet, don't feel discouraged. Open up a [discussion thread](https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeck/discussions) and let's talk about it.

## Official boards

Currently, there are two official boards: M and L variants. "M" stands for "middle" and "L" for "large". Both boards are available on [Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/paradajz/).

### M board

For more details on supported boards, check the dedicated [wiki page](https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeck/wiki/Connecting-components-to-OpenDeck). A page with [instructions on how to flash OpenDeck firmware](https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeck/wiki/Flashing-the-OpenDeck-firmware) to supported boards is also available. Support for custom boards can be easily added using [YAML descriptors](https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeck/wiki/Creating-custom-board-variant).
